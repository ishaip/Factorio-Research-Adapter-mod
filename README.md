# Factorio Mod: Research Adapter

I originally created this Factorio mod for my own enjoyment, aiming to adapt technology costs for the different stages of the game, especially with the official DLC. After sharing some details online, I was surprised and delighted when over 150 people expressed interest in using it themselves. Because of this interest, I decided to share the mod publicly so others can enjoy and benefit from it as well.

Thank you to everyone who reached out and encouraged me to release it!
